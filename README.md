## üë®‚Äçüéì About Me (Or not?)

Hey! I‚Äôm **Aditya Akolkar**, but you can call me **@schrodinderspet** here on GitHub. Much like the famous cat, I exist in a state of coding productivity and confusion‚Äîsimultaneously. My code? It both works and doesn‚Äôt, until you run it. But hey, let‚Äôs not rush to conclusions!

---

## üöÄ Skills That May or May Not Exist

- **Schr√∂dinger Debugging**: Bugs are both present and absent until someone else reviews the code.
  
- **Quantum Refactoring**: Code is both clean and spaghetti until compiled.
  
- **Heisenberg Commenting**: The more you look at my comments, the less sense they make.

## üìä GitHub Stats (Theoretical)

![GitHub Stats](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Stats-Classified%20until%20observed-blue)

The more you watch, the more mysterious my contributions get. Try it‚Äîopen the box, if you dare!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects (At Least, I Think)

1. **Quantum To-Do List**: All tasks are both done and not done. (I‚Äôll never tell which one.)

2. **Procrastination Simulator**: A cutting-edge tool that simulates the exact moment when I‚Äôll start working.

3. **The Perfect Code Editor**: It‚Äôs perfect, until you run it and reality kicks in.

---

## ü§ù How to Collaborate (Or Not)

- **Open an issue**: Will I respond? Who knows. I‚Äôm both responding and ignoring at once.

- **Fork the repo**: It contains code in both a working and broken state‚Äîfeel free to collapse the wave function.

- **Pull Request?**: Merged and rejected at the same time. Let‚Äôs see what quantum review brings.

## üì¨ Contact (If You Really Must)

- üìß **Email**: adi.akolkar12@gmail.com (Maybe?)
- üê¶ **Twitter**: [@pawticle_box](https://twitter.com/schrodinderspet) (If you find me...)
- üíº **LinkedIn**: [linkedin.com/in/aditya-akolkar](https://linkedin.com/in/aditya-akolkar) (Assuming LinkedIn still exists...)
