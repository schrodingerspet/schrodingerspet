## 👨‍🎓 About Me (Or not?)

Hey! I'm **Aditya Akolkar**, but you can call me **@schrodinderspet** here on GitHub. Much like the famous cat, I exist in a state of coding productivity and confusion—simultaneously. As a 2nd-year computer engineering student, my projects both work and don't, until you run them. But hey, let's not rush to open that box!

## 🚀 Skills That May or May Not Exist

- **Schrödinger Debugging**: Bugs are both present and absent until someone else reviews the code.
  
- **Quantum Refactoring**: Code is both clean and spaghetti until compiled.
  
- **Heisenberg Commenting**: The more you look at my comments, the less sense they make.
  
- **Cat-astrophic Version Control**: Commits are pushed and not pushed until observed.

## 📊 GitHub Stats (Theoretical)

![GitHub Stats](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Stats-Classified%20until%20observed-blue)

The more you watch, the more mysterious my contributions get. Try it—open the box, if you dare!

## 🛠️ Projects (At Least, I Think)

1. **Quantum To-Do List**: All tasks are both done and not done. (I'll never tell which one.)
2. **Procrastination Simulator**: A cutting-edge tool that simulates the exact moment when I'll start working.
3. **The Perfect Code Editor**: It's perfect, until you run it and reality kicks in.
4. **Schrödinger's Compiler**: It compiles everything perfectly... or does it?

## 🤝 How to Collaborate (Or Not)

- **Open an issue**: Will I respond? Who knows. I'm both responding and ignoring at once.
- **Fork the repo**: It contains code in both a working and broken state—feel free to collapse the wave function.
- **Pull Request?**: Merged and rejected at the same time. Let's see what quantum review brings.

## 📬 Contact (If You Really Must)

- 📧 **Email**: adi.akolkar12@gmail.com (Maybe?)
