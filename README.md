## 👨‍🎓 About Me

Greetings, quantum coders! I'm Aditya Akolkar, also known as @schrodinderspet in the GitHub realm. Like the infamous feline above, I exist in a superposition of coding brilliance and utter confusion as a 2nd-year computer engineering student. My projects are simultaneously functional and broken until you run them on your machine.

## 🚀 Schrödinger's Skill Set

- Superposition Debugging (bugs exist in all states until observed)
- Cat-Static Analysis (code is both clean and messy until reviewed)
- Quantum Commenting (comments that explain everything and nothing)
- Feline-Driven Development (letting the metaphorical cat walk on my keyboard for inspiration)

## 📊 GitHub Stats

![GitHub Stats](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Stats-Classified%20until%20box%20is%20opened-blue)

My commit history exists in multiple states simultaneously. Observe a flurry of activity or complete silence, you never know which until you check!

## 🛠️ Current Projects

1. **Schrödinger's To-Do List**: Tasks are both completed and pending until observed by my professor.
2. **Quantum Procrastination Simulator**: Calculates the probability of starting assignments before the deadline collapses.
3. **Superposition Code Editor**: Code is perfect until you try to compile it.

## 🤝 How to Collaborate

1. Open an issue (or don't, the issue both exists and doesn't until I check)
2. Fork the repository (it might contain alive and dead code simultaneously)
3. Submit a pull request (it will be merged and rejected until I review it)

## 📬 Contact

Reach out via quantum entanglement or, if you insist on classical communication:

- 📧 Email: adi.akolkar12@gmail.com
- 🐦 Twitter: [@schrodinderspet](https://twitter.com/schrodinderspet)
- 💼 LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/aditya-akolkar](https://linkedin.com)

Remember, the best way to understand my code is to not look at it. Observation causes the superposition to collapse into either a brilliant solution or a complete mess!
