## üë®‚Äçüéì About Me (Or not?)

Hey! I‚Äôm **Aditya Akolkar**, but you can call me **@schrodinderspet** here on GitHub. Much like the famous cat, I exist in a state of coding productivity and confusion‚Äîsimultaneously. My code? It both works and doesn‚Äôt, until you run it. But hey, let‚Äôs not rush to conclusions!

## üöÄ Skills That May or May Not Exist

- **Schr√∂dinger Debugging**: Bugs are both present and absent until someone else reviews the code.
  
- **Quantum Refactoring**: Code is both clean and spaghetti until compiled.
  
- **Heisenberg Commenting**: The more you look at my comments, the less sense they make.

## üìä GitHub Stats (Theoretical)

The more you watch, the more mysterious my contributions get. Try it‚Äîopen the box, if you dare!

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects (At Least, I Think)

![Anime Coding Gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPCSX4UHmuLGeA8/giphy.gif)

1. **Quantum To-Do List**: All tasks are both done and not done. (I‚Äôll never tell which one.)

2. **Procrastination Simulator**: A cutting-edge tool that simulates the exact moment when I‚Äôll start working.

3. **The Perfect Code Editor**: It‚Äôs perfect, until you run it and reality kicks in.

## ü§ù How to Collaborate (Or Not)

![Anime Collaborate Gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/10Phfgq9kMWCBO/giphy.gif)

- **Open an issue**: Will I respond? Who knows. I‚Äôm both responding and ignoring at once.

- **Fork the repo**: It contains code in both a working and broken state‚Äîfeel free to collapse the wave function.

- **Pull Request?**: Merged and rejected at the same time. Let‚Äôs see what quantum review brings.
