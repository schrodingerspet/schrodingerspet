## üß™ About Me

Greetings, curious observer! You've stumbled upon the GitHub profile of a developer who exists in a superposition of productivity and procrastination. Much like Schr√∂dinger's infamous feline, my projects are simultaneously groundbreaking and utterly useless until you clone the repository.

## üöÄ Skills

- Quantum Bug Creation
- Schr√∂dinger's Documentation (it exists and doesn't exist)
- Heisenberg Uncertainty Debugging (I know where the bug is or how fast it's propagating, but never both)
- Entangled Code Refactoring

## üìä GitHub Stats

![GitHub Stats](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Stats-Classified%20until%20observed-success)

My commit history follows the uncertainty principle. The more you try to measure my productivity, the more it fluctuates wildly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects

1. **Schr√∂dinger's Todo App**: Tasks are both done and not done until you check them.
2. **Quantum Random Number Generator**: It's random 60% of the time, every time.
3. **Heisenberg's GPS**: The more accurate the location, the less you know about your speed (and vice versa).

## ü§ù How to Collaborate

1. Open an issue (or don't, who knows in this quantum realm?)
2. Fork the repository (careful, it might fork back)
3. Submit a pull request (it will be simultaneously merged and rejected until I review it)

## üì¨ Contact

You can reach out to me via quantum entanglement or, if you insist on classical communication:

- üìß Email: schrodinger.coder@superposition.com
- üê¶ Twitter: [@SchroedingerDev](https://twitter.com)
- üíº LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/schrodinger-dev](https://linkedin.com)

Remember, the best way to understand my code is to not look at it. Observation changes the outcome!
